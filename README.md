Design Process

I choose sombre dark colours. Grey, black, red.

I choose long narrow font. What was used in old book titles.
Even the simple way of writing my name, was inspired by H.G Wells.
The pictures I wanted to reflect a old school science fiction mixed with nature.

A robot being reprogrammed. 

An image of raindrops in an oil stained puddle, looked like a galaxy.

Trees resembling the network of a brain

A dandelion pushing and flowering through cement. 

These were all personal.
 

The final example used the same colours and only one image.

## The Development Process.

It was long and challenging. 
# What was challenging??
Everything. I wouldn't want it any other way.

The greatest challenge was understanding what was expected of me in the design process.
I now know the important lesson of listening and understanding the client before starting to build. I learnt the hierachy of decision making. Check with the desicion maker before starting. If it is not was what expected in the project you loose time and energy to hit the deadline.


I should have used the complementry colour techniques and typography to create a logo and a better understanding of Figma is a must.

# Where to from here???

Make it mobile ready with @media query.
Update with new skills. 
 Create and use vectors for the icons instead of screen shots. The colour scheme to reflect more where I want to be.

 A better desinged plan.
